# [WIP] Pyramid

Pyramid is a project in the spirit of 3b1b's and ManimCommunity's *manim*, as well as our own, *PyPen* and *Canvim*.

Pyramid is basically a version of manim re-implemented from scratch to better suit a different style of programming. Where manim was created by a mathematician, Pyramid is made by engineers. Ï€ ~ 3 ~ e


## Usage
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Canvim/Pyramid.git
cd Pyramid
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, from the Pyramid root directory, you can run
`python example.py` or `.\live_render.bat` (or `./live_render.sh` on linux/mac).

The "Live Render" scripts depend on `nodemon` which is an npm package.
If you don't have nodemon installed, just run `npm install -g nodemon`.
